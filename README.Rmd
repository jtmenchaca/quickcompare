# quickcompare

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `quickcompare` is to provide a tool to quickly compare column values by groups with the appropriate statistical tests and output the results in a publication-ready table.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `quickcompare` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jtmenchaca/quickcompare")
```

## Create a comparison

`quickcompare` only has two functions.  The first and primary function is `compare_cols_by_group()` which does the heavy lifting of comparing data across groups.

```{r example}
library(quickcompare)
library(dplyr, quietly = T, warn.conflicts = F)
library(palmerpenguins, quietly = T, warn.conflicts = F)

data(penguins, package = "palmerpenguins")
penguins_data = penguins |>
  filter(species != "Gentoo") # Simplifying example for only 2 groups

summary = penguins_data |> 
  compare_cols_by_group(
    group_col = "species", 
    binary_or_cat_cols = c("island", "sex", "year"), 
    continuous_cols = c("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", 
                        "flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g")
  )

```

### Binary/Categorical data

Binary/categorical columns are compared across groups using the Chi-square test or the Fisher's Exact test, depending on the count of results.  If there are no observations for a binary/categorical column in one of the groups, no p-value is provided.  If this happens and more than two groups are being evaluated, and if the statistical testing is still important, consider limiting the analysis to fewer groups where all groups have at least one observation.

```{r}
penguins_data |> 
  compare_cols_by_group(
    group_col = "species", 
    binary_or_cat_cols = c("island", "sex", "year")
  )
```

### Numeric data

Numeric columns are compared between two groups by either 1) the Student's t-test if the column has a normal distribution or 2) the Wilcoxon signed-rank test if the distribution is non-normal. The Shapiroâ€“Wilk test is used to evaluate normality.

When comparing between three or more groups, the ANOVA test is used to compare continuous columns.

If a continuous variable has a normal distribution, the mean and standard deviation are provided.  If non-normal, the median and interquartile range are provided.

Note that integer data is analyzed as if continuous. 

```{r results='hide'}
penguins_data |> 
  compare_cols_by_group(
    group_col = "species", 
    continuous_cols = c("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", 
                        "flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g")
  )
```

## Save your results to an Excel file

When making a report or publication, nearly every table will need some fine-tuning in a program like Microsoft Excel.  Neatly convert your comparison to an XLSX file with  `save_comparison_to_xlsx()`.  Note that this function still returns a dataframe - the output can still be used for more analysis.

```{r results='hide'}
penguins_data |> 
  compare_cols_by_group(
    group_col = "species", 
    binary_or_cat_cols = c("island", "sex", "year"), 
    continuous_cols = c("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", 
                        "flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g")
  ) |>
   save_comparison_to_xlsx(
     file_name = "Comparison.xlsx",
     title = "Table 1: Characteristics of Penguins by Species"
  )
```

It should leave you with a tidy XLSX file that looks like the following:

## Extra options

There are a few extra options available for the `compare_cols_by_group()` function.

Use the `remove_group_col_NA` and `cols_to_remove_NA` to remove rows with missing values in specific columns. 

Sometimes, you want to use a subset of your data to compare across groups for your binary/categorical data.  To specify the column you would like to use as a subset, use the `binary_or_cat_cols_subpop` argument. 

If the `binary_or_cat_cols_subpop` argument is provided, it must be the same length as the `binary_or_cat_cols` argument where each value in `binary_or_cat_cols` aligns by index to the value in the `binary_or_cat_cols_subgroup`.  Columns that should use the general population should have a value of the empty string `""`.  

For now, any columns specified in `binary_or_cat_cols_subpop` should be binary columns, where a value of `1` will be used to identify the appropriate subpopulation.
