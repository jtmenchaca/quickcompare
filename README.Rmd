The goal of quickcompare is to simply and statistically compare columns by group and output the results in a publication-ready table. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of quickcompare from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jtmenchaca/quickcompare")
```

## Create a comparison

```{r example}
library(quickcompare)
library(dplyr, quietly = T, warn.conflicts = F)
library(palmerpenguins, quietly = T, warn.conflicts = F)

data(penguins, package = "palmerpenguins")
penguins_data = penguins |>
  filter(species != "Gentoo") # Simplifying example for only 2 groups

summary = penguins_data |> 
  compare_cols_by_group(
    group_col = "species", 
    binary_or_cat_cols = c("island", "sex", "year"), 
    continuous_cols = c("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", 
                        "flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g")
  )

```

By default, the binary/categorical columns are compared across groups using the Chi square test or the Fisher's Exact test, depending on the count of results.  If there are no observations for a given subgroup, no p-value is provided (consider comparing across sub-groups that all have at least one observation in a separate analysis).

```{r}
penguins_data |> 
  compare_cols_by_group(
    group_col = "species", 
    binary_or_cat_cols = c("island", "sex", "year")
  )
```

Continuous columns are compared between two groups by either 1) the Student's t-test if the column has a normal distribution or 2) the Wilcoxon signed-rank test if the distribution is non-normal. The Shapiroâ€“Wilk test is used to evaluate normality.

When comparing between three groups, the ANOVA test is used to compare continuous columns.

If a continuous variable has a non-normal distribution by the Shaprio-Wilk test, it is summarized using IQR.

```{r results='hide'}
penguins_data |> 
  compare_cols_by_group(
    group_col = "species", 
    continuous_cols = c("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", 
                        "flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g")
  )
```

Use the `remove_group_col_NA` and `cols_to_remove_NA` to remove rows with missing values in specific columns. 

Sometimes, you want to use a subset of your dataset to compare across groups for your binary/categorical data.  To specify the column you would like to use as a subset, use the `binary_or_cat_cols_subpop` argument. 

If the `binary_or_cat_cols_subpop` argument is provided, it must be the same length as the `binary_or_cat_cols` argument where each value in `binary_or_cat_cols` aligns by index to the value in the `binary_or_cat_cols_subgroup`.  Columns that should use the general population should have a value of the empty string `""`.  

For now, any columns specified in `binary_or_cat_cols_subpop` should be binary columns, where a value of `1` will be used to identify the appropriate subpopulation. 

## Save your results to Excel

Neatly translate your formatted results to an XLSX file with the helper function `save_comparison_to_xlsx`.

```{r results='hide'}
penguins_data |> 
  compare_cols_by_group(
    group_col = "species", 
    binary_or_cat_cols = c("island", "sex", "year"), 
    continuous_cols = c("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", 
                        "flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g")
  ) |>
   save_comparison_to_xlsx(
     file_name = "Comparison.xlsx",
     title = "Table 1: Characteristics of Penguins by Species"
  )
```

It should leave you with a tidy XLSX file with something that looks like the following:
